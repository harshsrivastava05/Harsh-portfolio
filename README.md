# Harsh Srivastava - Portfolio

A **Neo-Swiss Brutalist** portfolio website built with **Next.js 15**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Three.js**. This project features a high-performance, interactive design with a focus on bold typography, raw aesthetics, and fluid animations.

## ✨ Features

- **Neo-Swiss Brutalist Design**: Massive typography, high contrast, and raw grid layouts.
- **Interactive 3D Cursor**: Custom particle swarm cursor powered by `react-three-fiber` that trails and reacts to movement.
- **Dynamic Project Pages**: Detailed case study pages for each project with image carousels and technical breakdowns.
- **Smooth Animations**: Powered by `framer-motion` for seamless page transitions and scroll effects.
- **Responsive**: Fully optimized for all devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **3D Graphics**: [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) & [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber)
- **Font**: `Space Grotesk` (Headings) & `Inter` (Body)



## 📂 Project Structure

- `src/app`: App Router pages and layouts.
- `src/components`: Reusable UI components (Hero, Projects, InteractiveCursor, etc.).
- `src/data`: JSON data for projects and personal info.
- `public/assets`: Static assets (images, fonts).

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The design follows a **"Premium Minimalist"** approach with Brutalist influences:
- **Strict Monochrome**: Primarily Black (`#050505`) and White (`#FFFFFF`).
- **Function over Form**: Raw borders, visible grids, and system-like typography.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Subtle hover states and cursor physics to enhance engagement without clutter.
